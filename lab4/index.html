			<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocode and problem solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Write psuedocode for a simple game in java and place it here. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems mainly with choosing what task and game to do for the pseudocode.
						I also struggled with using the pre and code tags, mainly cause I don't really understand how it works.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab was pretty difficult with formatting, but overall it was pretty nice doing the pseudocode and figuring stuff out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>

			<div class="code">
				<h2> Pseudocode</h2>
				
				<pre><code> //creating a simple Memory card game
	//create a grid with pairs of cards 
	//create a 4x4 grid of cards with pairs
 // create a timer 
	// after player starts the game and finishes shuffle start a timer til all pairs found
 // assign images or numbers to the pairs 
	// two cards have the same image or number count as one pair 
 // shuffle cards on the grid 
	//randomly move cards to different positions on the grid
 // create a way to track number of pairs found
	//when one card is clicked if the second one is the same then one pair found
 //shuffle cards each time game restarts/played
	//set a play button/restart button that initiates shuffle 
		// sets cards face down
 //First card clicked goes face up once pressed and stays for comparison
	// second card goes face up and compares with first
		//if the cards are a pair stay face up 
		//if not both go face down
	// keeps comparing until all pairs are found 
 //End of game with results, time and asks if the player wants to restart 
	//print time
	// display restart
	//display end of game text
