            <h2> Problems </h2>
            <p> I had some problems getting the buttons to work properly but I was able to work through it.
                I have them changing some of the css for their sections and it was a little tricky figuring it out.
                It was pretty fun to figure out though.

               This lab was pretty cool to work through. I think I definitely 
               need to work through some of this a little more, but overall I understand it.

            <h2> Results</h2>
            <P> The results would be on the page with the buttons. Like the one below.</P>
