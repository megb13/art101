                    <p> I had problems getting started mostly because I got sick the day I was planning on starting. 
                        I also had problems with the javascirpt not working the way I wanted. I was able to figure it out with some help from a friend. </p>

                    <h2> Reflection </h2>
                    <p> This lab was nice to work on. I got to look at some of the javascript stuff.
                         I don't fully understand it at the moment but I'm hoping once I'm back in class I'll understand better. 
                        This lab was pretty difficult to get things working. </p>
