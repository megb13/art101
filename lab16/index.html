    <h2> Problems</h2>
    <p> I didn't have many problems doing this lab. I mostly followed along with the jsbin code from monday 
        and changed it to fit what was needed for this lab. I struggled a little with changing some of the 
        things but overall I didn't have any major problems. </p>
