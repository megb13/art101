            <h2> Problems </h2>
            <p> I didn't have many problems in this lab. I did struggle with some of the js code in the console. 
                I was able to figure it out eventually though.</p>

            <h2> Reflection </h2>
            <p>
                This lab was fun, I liked working on the JS file. I had to work through some small 
                issues with that and I think it was really cool to work through and understand 
                anon functions a little better.
            </p>

    <div class="minor-section">
            <h2> Results</h2>
            <P> The results would be in the console.</P>
